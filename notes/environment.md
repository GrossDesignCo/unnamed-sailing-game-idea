# Environment

## Waves

Hexagonal grid
Each node knows about it's 6 closest neighbors

Pressure setting on each
Pressure propagates out to neighbors with some direction component, and some percentage modifier
Maybe slightly offset 60degree pushes so as to make the pressure waves more accurate?

Player's boat can be affected much more dynamically, based on their position relative to any nodes

## Wind

Start with a simple uniform system, speed & direction
Later figure out how to make it variable?
Speed & direction should change somewhat randomly over time

Player gets a wind gague, that points in the direction & somehow indicates speed

## Birds!

Sea birds, white & grey over the blues of the ocean, soft noises
Maybe simple boid? Coding?

## Questions

How to make even circles propagate, instead of just the shape of the grid?

How do waves interact with solid objects? Maybe to start it's just open sea?

Gusts of wind?
