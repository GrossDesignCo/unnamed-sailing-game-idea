## Waves

100x100 (XxY) grid creating a vector field

Or maybe a hexagonal/triangular grid?

Or maybe free floating particles representing the water

Some start event, or randomly initialize direction and magnitude

Each point takes in force from it's neighbors

Create a gradient from white to black representing the direction and magnitude of force

## Ship

Affected by the waves that are right around it

Also user can push in some direction

## Clouds

Opportunity to experiment with procedural generation

Clouds get dark and stormy as the waters become more chaotic

## Day/Night Cycle

Cycle from dawn to dusk

As night falls, little spotlights on the boat come on & shine out at the waves

## Environments

Pool/Lake

- enclosed boat of water, closed system, easier inputs

Harbor

- mostly enclosed, one entry point for external forces to push and pull

Ocean

- totally open sides, forces coming from mostly one direction, but no point-source


## Wind

Maybe a game where the player has to figure out sailing mechanics, like angling the ship and sails relative to the wind?

# Waves of grain

Each stall of grass is like a vector that gets pushed around by waves of energy or particles flowing past it
